# Flower Recognition ðŸŒ¸
This project is a Flower Recognition Application built using PyQt5, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and SQLite. The application allows users to identify flowers in real-time using a webcam, get care tips, and interact with a user-friendly interface. It also includes voice feedback and allows for searching and adding new flowers.

## Features
- **Real-time flower recognition using a pre-trained model.**
- **Voice feedback for detected flowers and care tips.**
- **Wikipedia integration for more information on recognized flowers.**
- **Image quality check to ensure the clarity of the captured image.**
- **Flower care guide: Get detailed care instructions for recognized flowers.**
- **Add custom flowers with care tips to the database.**
- **Search functionality for finding flowers in the care guide.**
- **Video file support: Analyze flowers in uploaded videos.**
- **Light/Dark theme toggle for user interface customization.**

## Technologies Used
- **Python: Main programming language.**
- **PyQt5: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).**
- **OpenCV: For image processing and real-time video feed.**
- **TensorFlow: For flower classification using a pre-trained deep learning model.**
- **SQLite: To store flower care tips.**
- **pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.**
